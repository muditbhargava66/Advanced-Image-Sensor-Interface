# MIPI CSI-2 Protocol - Simple Guide

## ü§î What is MIPI CSI-2? (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine you have a camera in your phone that needs to send pictures to the phone's brain (processor). MIPI CSI-2 is like a super-fast highway that carries these pictures.

**Think of it like this:**
- Your camera is like a person taking photos
- The phone's processor is like a photo album where pictures get stored
- MIPI CSI-2 is like a conveyor belt that moves photos from the camera to the album
- This conveyor belt is REALLY fast and can carry multiple photos at the same time!

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why is it Special?

1. **Super Fast**: It can send pictures so quickly that you can record smooth videos
2. **Power Saver**: It doesn't drain your phone battery much
3. **Multiple Lanes**: Like having 1-4 conveyor belts working together
4. **Error Checking**: It makes sure pictures don't get damaged while traveling

## üîß How We Use It in Our Code

### Basic Setup (Simple Example)

```python
# Think of this as setting up your conveyor belt
from advanced_image_sensor_interface.sensor_interface.protocol.mipi import MIPIDriver, MIPIConfig

# Configure the conveyor belt
config = MIPIConfig(
    lanes=4,                    # Use 4 conveyor belts (fastest)
    data_rate_mbps=2500,       # Speed of each belt
    pixel_format="RAW12",       # Type of pictures (12-bit quality)
    resolution=(1920, 1080),    # Picture size (Full HD)
    frame_rate=60,              # 60 pictures per second
    virtual_channel=0,          # Which channel to use (like TV channel)
    continuous_clock=True,      # Keep the belt running smoothly
    ecc_enabled=True,          # Check for damaged pictures
    crc_enabled=True           # Double-check picture quality
)

# Start the conveyor belt system
camera = MIPIDriver(config)
```

### Taking Pictures

```python
# Start the camera
camera.start_streaming()

# Take a picture
picture = camera.capture_frame()

# The picture is now ready to use!
print(f"Got a picture that is {picture.width} x {picture.height} pixels")

# Stop the camera when done
camera.stop_streaming()
```

### Advanced Usage - Multiple Cameras

```python
# Set up multiple cameras (like having multiple conveyor belts)
cameras = []

for i in range(3):  # 3 cameras
    config = MIPIConfig(
        lanes=2,                    # 2 lanes each (to share bandwidth)
        data_rate_mbps=1250,       # Slower speed per camera
        virtual_channel=i,          # Each camera gets its own channel
        resolution=(1280, 720),     # HD quality
        frame_rate=30               # 30 pictures per second
    )
    cameras.append(MIPIDriver(config))

# Start all cameras
for camera in cameras:
    camera.start_streaming()

# Take synchronized pictures
pictures = []
for camera in cameras:
    picture = camera.capture_frame()
    pictures.append(picture)

print(f"Got {len(pictures)} pictures at the same time!")
```

## üìä Picture Formats (Types of Photos)

### RAW Formats (Like Film Negatives)
```python
# Different quality levels
formats = {
    "RAW8": "Basic quality (like old photos)",
    "RAW10": "Good quality (like digital camera)",
    "RAW12": "Great quality (like professional camera)",
    "RAW14": "Amazing quality (like movie camera)"
}

# Choose based on what you need
config = MIPIConfig(
    pixel_format="RAW12",  # Great quality for most uses
    # ... other settings
)
```

### Color Formats (Ready-to-View Photos)
```python
# Different color formats
color_formats = {
    "YUV420": "Compressed color (saves space)",
    "YUV422": "Better color (more space)",
    "RGB565": "Basic color (16-bit)",
    "RGB888": "Full color (24-bit, like computer screen)"
}

# For immediate viewing
config = MIPIConfig(
    pixel_format="RGB888",  # Full color, ready to display
    # ... other settings
)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Phone Camera
```python
# Setting up a phone camera
phone_camera_config = MIPIConfig(
    lanes=4,                    # Maximum speed
    data_rate_mbps=2500,       # Very fast
    pixel_format="RAW12",       # High quality for processing
    resolution=(4032, 3024),    # 12 megapixel photos
    frame_rate=30,              # Smooth video
    continuous_clock=True,      # Consistent performance
    ecc_enabled=True,          # Error checking
    crc_enabled=True           # Quality assurance
)

phone_camera = MIPIDriver(phone_camera_config)
```

### Example 2: Security Camera
```python
# Setting up a security camera (needs to run 24/7)
security_camera_config = MIPIConfig(
    lanes=2,                    # Moderate speed (saves power)
    data_rate_mbps=1250,       # Sufficient for security
    pixel_format="YUV420",      # Compressed (saves storage)
    resolution=(1920, 1080),    # Full HD
    frame_rate=15,              # 15 fps (saves bandwidth)
    continuous_clock=False,     # Save power when possible
    ecc_enabled=True,          # Important for security footage
    crc_enabled=True           # Ensure footage integrity
)

security_camera = MIPIDriver(security_camera_config)
```

### Example 3: Drone Camera
```python
# Setting up a drone camera (needs to be lightweight and efficient)
drone_camera_config = MIPIConfig(
    lanes=2,                    # Balance speed and power
    data_rate_mbps=1500,       # Good quality
    pixel_format="RAW10",       # Good quality, not too heavy
    resolution=(2560, 1440),    # 2K quality
    frame_rate=60,              # Smooth for flying
    continuous_clock=True,      # Consistent for stabilization
    ecc_enabled=True,          # Important when flying
    crc_enabled=True           # Ensure footage quality
)

drone_camera = MIPIDriver(drone_camera_config)
```

## üîç Error Handling (When Things Go Wrong)

### Basic Error Checking
```python
try:
    # Try to take a picture
    picture = camera.capture_frame()
    print("Picture taken successfully!")
    
except Exception as error:
    print(f"Something went wrong: {error}")
    
    # Try to fix the problem
    camera.reset()
    print("Camera reset, trying again...")
```

### Advanced Error Handling
```python
from advanced_image_sensor_interface.sensor_interface.mipi_protocol import MIPIProtocolValidator

# Create a picture quality checker
validator = MIPIProtocolValidator()

# Check if a picture is good
def check_picture_quality(picture_data):
    result = validator.validate_packet(picture_data)
    
    if result.is_valid:
        print("Picture is perfect! ‚úÖ")
        return True
    else:
        print(f"Picture has problems: {result.error_message} ‚ùå")
        return False

# Use it when taking pictures
picture = camera.capture_frame()
if check_picture_quality(picture.data):
    # Picture is good, use it
    save_picture(picture)
else:
    # Picture is bad, take another one
    print("Taking another picture...")
    picture = camera.capture_frame()
```

## ‚ö° Performance Tips (Making It Faster)

### Tip 1: Use More Lanes
```python
# Slow (1 conveyor belt)
slow_config = MIPIConfig(lanes=1, data_rate_mbps=2500)

# Fast (4 conveyor belts)
fast_config = MIPIConfig(lanes=4, data_rate_mbps=2500)

# The fast version can carry 4x more pictures!
```

### Tip 2: Choose the Right Picture Format
```python
# For storage (smaller files)
storage_config = MIPIConfig(pixel_format="YUV420")  # Compressed

# For quality (bigger files)
quality_config = MIPIConfig(pixel_format="RAW12")   # Uncompressed

# For display (ready to show)
display_config = MIPIConfig(pixel_format="RGB888")  # Color
```

### Tip 3: Buffer Management (Picture Queue)
```python
from advanced_image_sensor_interface.utils.buffer_manager import BufferManager

# Create a picture queue (like a waiting line)
buffer_manager = BufferManager(
    pool_sizes={1920*1080*3: 10},  # 10 pictures can wait in line
    max_total_memory_mb=100        # Don't use more than 100MB
)

# Use the queue when taking pictures
with buffer_manager.get_buffer(1920*1080*3) as picture_buffer:
    # Take picture into the buffer
    camera.capture_frame_to_buffer(picture_buffer)
    # Picture is automatically managed
```

## üéØ Common Use Cases

```

## üö® Troubleshooting (Fixing Problems)

### Problem 1: Pictures are Blurry
```python
# Solution: Check if camera is moving too fast
config = MIPIConfig(
    frame_rate=120,  # Increase frame rate for fast movement
    exposure_time=1000,  # Shorter exposure time
    # ... other settings
)
```

### Problem 2: Pictures are Too Dark
```python
# Solution: Increase exposure or gain
config = MIPIConfig(
    exposure_time=20000,  # Longer exposure (more light)
    analog_gain=2.0,      # Amplify the signal
    # ... other settings
)
```

### Problem 3: Camera Stops Working
```python
# Solution: Add error recovery
def robust_camera_operation():
    try:
        camera.start_streaming()
        return camera.capture_frame()
    
    except Exception as error:
        print(f"Camera error: {error}")
        
        # Try to fix it
        camera.reset()
        camera.start_streaming()
        
        return camera.capture_frame()
```

## üìà Performance Monitoring

```python
from advanced_image_sensor_interface.performance.monitor import PerformanceMonitor

# Monitor camera performance
monitor = PerformanceMonitor()

# Start monitoring
monitor.start_monitoring()

# Take pictures and monitor performance
for i in range(100):
    start_time = monitor.get_timestamp()
    
    picture = camera.capture_frame()
    
    end_time = monitor.get_timestamp()
    
    # Record how long it took
    monitor.record_frame_time(end_time - start_time)

# Get performance report
report = monitor.get_performance_report()
print(f"Average frame time: {report.average_frame_time_ms} ms")
print(f"Frames per second: {report.actual_fps}")
print(f"Dropped frames: {report.dropped_frames}")
```
